I am pursuing a **PhD in Data Science** at Indiana University Indianapolis. I previously earned an **MS in Computer Science** from Tufts University and a **BSc in Mathematics & Statistical Science** from University College London.

I am broadly interested in **information extraction**, **causal knowledge discovery**, and **LLM persona**. My current work develops datasets, algorithms, and evaluation methods for extracting structured knowledge from scientific text, and for understanding how large language models represent causal relations and persona like behavior.

**Vision.** I work toward LLMs with **grounded, multimodal understanding**: combining text with visual, auditory, and other sensory inputs to support **reliable, context-aware reasoning**. The goal is to **improve human–AI collaboration**, enabling systems that communicate clearly and assist rigorous scientific and everyday decision-making.

**Prospective collaborators.** I welcome collaborations in information extraction, causal representation learning and human–AI interaction. If our interests align, or you’d like to discuss related ideas, please reach out at **bofudong@iu.edu**.
